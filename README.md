# Alzheimer-Brain-Blood-Samples
NCBI GEO samples of gene expression microarray data from Alzheimers middle temporal gyrus blood of brain
The original text file with the gene expression values is too large for github and must be broken up into two parts to post. 
There is a direct link to the file to run in the Rmarkdown script. 
Not fully analyzed but found at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE109887
